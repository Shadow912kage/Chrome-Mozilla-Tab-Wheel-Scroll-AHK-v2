# Chrome-Mozilla-Tab-Wheel-Scroll-AHK-v2
Scrolling tabs with the mouse wheel, etc.<br>
Based on a script written by someone on the internet (Xsoft?).<br>
Convert to AHK2.0 to fix it and add some hotkeys.<br>
<hr>
Functions other than those related to the mouse wheel have been separated into Mouse-Miscellaneous-Utility (MouseMiscUtility.ahk).
